# Realistic_Car_Crash

Simple edit of the famous [salty_vehicleblackout](https://github.com/SaltyGrandpa/salty_vehicleblackout) with the use of [InteractSound](https://github.com/plunkettscott/FiveM-Scripts/tree/master/InteractSound) and some shake natives


## About

It not really realistic, its just more dramatic, simple fade in and fade out, with a heartbeat sound effect as well as use of CameraShake native...

Its just a little edit really... nothing more to add... all the info you need is pretty much already in the script just download the pack put two folders in your server directory add

```lua
start Interactsound
start salty_vehicleblackout
```

And you're good to go :)

ENJOY!
